Hi everybody! Here is my very first blog post. I'll write mostly things I learned daily related to machine learning, computer vision, NLP, and statistics.
Hope you will enjoy reading my writing!

The following is a sample of how mathjx works:

\\[ \mathbf{X}\_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}\_{n,k} \mathbf{B}\_{k,p} \\]

\\[ \mathbf{X} = \mathcal{Z} \mathbf{P^\mathsf{T}} \\]

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
