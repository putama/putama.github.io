My name is Ajie. I am a 2nd year PhD student in [UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at the [Department of Computer Science, Technical University Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp), co-advised by [Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/staff_ukp/prof_dr_iryna_gurevych/index.en.jsp) and [Nafise Sadat Moosavi](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/staff_ukp/detailseite_mitarbeiter_1_43136.en.jsp). Before working in the UKP Lab, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Indonesia, and later received my M.Sc. from Brown University, advised by [James Tompkin](http://jamestompkin.com/) and [Pedro Felzenszwalb](http://cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/).
